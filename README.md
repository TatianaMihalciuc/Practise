# Practise

Welcome to my repository of solutions for Quality Assurance (QA) tasks! Here, you'll find my solutions for a variety of QA challenges, including those from Udemy courses and those I've encountered outside of those courses.

As a dedicated self-study learner, I'm always looking for opportunities to deepen my knowledge and improve my QA skills. This repository serves as a way for me to track my progress and share my solutions with others who may be facing similar challenges.

Whether you're looking for a solution to a specific QA problem or simply want to explore new concepts in the field, I hope you find this repository to be a valuable resource. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions or comments, and I look forward to collaborating with other learners in the QA community!
